# Quick Node Server

This is a command line shortcut to set up a node server and associated directories.

## How to use:

- Open QuickNodeServer.sh
- Select All, and Copy
- Open Terminal
- Open your bash_profile (``subl ~/.bash_profile``)
- Paste the code (anywhere, though best at the bottom)
- Save the file, and close it
- Back on Terminal, type ``reload`` which will update your machine with the changes (or `source ~/.bash_profile` if that doesn't work)
- On Terminal, type ``node_touch [file name]``, and you're all set!

## What the script will do:
First, the script will create a directory and file structure.

```
project
│   package.json
│
└───client
│   │
│   └───public
│   │   │
│   │   └───img
│   │   |
│   │   └───javascript
│   │   │      jquery.js
│   │   │      script.js
│   │   └───stylesheets
│   │          style.css
│   │
│   └───views
│          index.html
│   
└───server
│      index.js
│      
└───node_modules
       ...
```

Then, it will run the following commends on your Terminal:
``npm init`` which will initialize npm in the directory created. Follow the questions asked
and answer as need. None of them are mandatory, and they can be edited later. <br>
Then, it will install the following packages to run Express and Nodemon: <br>
``npm install express --save`` <br>
``npm install mustache-express --save`` <br>
``npm install nodemon --save`` <br><br>
Express is a package that will handle the server routing and the asset serving. Read more here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/express <br>

Mustache is a template engine for HTML files and more. Read more about 'Usage' here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/mustache

## Extras
Once sublime opens, head to Package.json. On line 6 for "scripts", add:
``"start": "nodemon server/server.js"``. <br>
This will allow you to start the server from your Terminal and run Nodemon by typing ``npm start``.<br>
